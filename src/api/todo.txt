- Models: just think, before adding new models, if there a way to standard CRUD operations? e.g implement an update functionality like TT, or where a single find method can be called using params for the field name and values e.g.
    Document.delete({passedInFieldName: passedInVal})
    - Is there existing complex mongoose functionaility to do something similar?
    - Like, for the update, we could create a new object(?), loop through all private props, and assign the values to matching prop names, then send an update, or how to to update fields that have changed?

- Migrate data from ibasemodel into basemodel as abstract props or methods. move create method into base model
- remove this.empty form methods not in basemodel class
- create dynamic query method for each CRUD, like so maybe?:
    function FindQuery (query: {fieldname, fieldValue}) {
        const res = await Document.find(query)
    }
    function UpdateQuery () {
        etc
    }
