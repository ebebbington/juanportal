- tests: test for different environments e.g. when connecting to the database
- tests: be more strict on tests
- tests: somehow get connection string of db to check it gainst the config
- tests: ytest files like config or .env
- tests: look into profile model deleteAll and deleteAllByName methods and their usage, also develop tests once i decide what to do with them
- tests: race condition in ProfileModel, methods, findManyByName. Some reason there is a 7th profile - i asusme not being deleted from somewhere
- base model: maybe call the validateoutputfields method inside the fill method? idea is,
              fill fills the model with data from a passed in document. whereas vof strips out proeprties that we dont wanna expose
              so, a model should have a property matching each in in the database, and fte should define the ones to fill
- base model: maybe implement fillabled property
- IMAGE HELPER: decide whether to save images on api or main serevr, so the api creates the file names and stuff for the model, but the main servr saved the file? OR actually once the profile has saved, send a request to the original server (api kinda endpoint) then the ain server would handle the response there
                or route anything on /image to the api container?
- tests: middleware
