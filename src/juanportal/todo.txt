- Sort out stylings (css modules) for register form component
- Develop tests for reacto components
- Better style the client side header and sidebar
- For profile component, when no more are left but count was defined, find more.
- Develop stylings for css objects from home page and develop components out of them
- implement JWT?
- Make all other components extend the base component and use the notify method for everything thats required
- inside basecomponent notify method, remove the old script FROM THE BODY before adding a new one
- address webpack warnings in the console when compiling
- address console errors of why it throws an error for removing a `closest()` yet it still works?
- address the problem of my having to ignore ts error on vNotify in base component
- regarding logging, maybe i could implement something that displays the CALLING calsses name? e.g. we have class B that extends onto A, and inside that A class each method is logged with: console.log()
    Just make note of the above regardless because it could come in useful e.g. dont have to research it again
- Also make note that we can get the function name we are in, e.g.
    function a () {
        console.log(arguments.callee.name)
    }
    a() // 'a'
    // and still works when called form other functions
    function b () {
        a()
    }
    b() // 'a'
